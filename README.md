# Second Party
- Taking the basic laws of the program

- Be patient, not in haste and indifference
- Take small mistakes seriously
- Know the main objective of the program and understand the requirements to do the best
- Do not mind that I am here to display the extent of my intelligence **No, I am here to provide a service in the simplest way**
- The system must be easy to use to serve all users and to be easily modified by the developer
- In the event that any problem arises, do not receive, *I understand the problem, and then it is easy to solve it.*
- Do not rush to brainstorm and extract additional ideas, “leave them for the future,” because complications and problems may occur to you at the time of the start, and do not use assumptions and the phrase: **what if**
- You should do several tests of your code and try all parts of it
- Learning and diversity must continue to increase knowledge and skills :innocent:
 - When facing any problem, search for a solution for it, and then ask for help or advice in that problem. **Do not be shy** :no_mouth: .
